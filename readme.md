# Hangman
This is a simple implementation of a hangman game designed entirely by myself in vanilla python.

Comes with a library of words to be used by default, but supports external csv's being used for custom word lists.
Simply pass the name of the csv as the first argument.
```
python3 hangman.py custom.csv
```

Looking to expand it to multiple simple games soon, so repo name may change to reflect that.
